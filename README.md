## What am I looking at?
Hello. You are looking at my repository that I use for miscellenous files (mostly CSS) for me to link them elsewhere
## Why?
I know you aren't asking that

But I'm not the biggest fan of copy and pasting the same code in different places, especially when it comes to editing it, so here we are.

If someone comes accross this page and feels so inclined to suggest a better place to put this. Be my guest ^^
